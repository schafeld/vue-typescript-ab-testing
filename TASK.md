# Task

I am applying for a senior frontend developer role (focus a/b-testing; tech stack: Vue3 with Typescript, some Node.js expertise expected, also basic Python and SQL).

Set up a simple Vue3 app, like a very simple Single Page App online shop with placeholder/lorem ipsum content. Simulate a simple sales funnel and implement concepts for A/B-testing, personalisation, and tracking. Use extensive code commentary to explain Vue and A/B-testing concepts used. Produce explanatory documentation for these features and Vue techniques.
The intention is to use this project to train for a technical interview, to learn/memorize best practices, and explain common Vue and Typescript techniques and specifically tracking and A/B-testing approaches.

Tech Stack

- Vue3
- Typescript
- Routing
- Pinia (but offer some solutions with simpler techniques for stae handling)
- I18N (German and English)

The look of the app is of secondary importance, simply use some standard UI library, e.g. Material Design.

Use additional techniques according to contemporary trends.

Maybe log some tracking signals into a file or a SQLlite database and write some simple Python script for rudimentary analysis.

Use the files in the folder ./DOCUMENTS ot obtain additional information on what kind of knowledge is to be demonstrated in this project.

Create your own planning documentation to support code generation with generative AI where it seems adequate.
