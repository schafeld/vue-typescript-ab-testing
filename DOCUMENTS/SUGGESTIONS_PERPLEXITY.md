## Prompt

I am applying for a senior frontend developer role (focus a/b-testing; tech stack: Vue3 with Typescript, some Node.js expertise expected).

I'll have a technical interview with coding challenges during a call, so no homework to prepare.

Help me prepare for this call with, for instance, for instance typical questions, challenges, or quizzes.

## Answer

## Senior Frontend Developer Interview Prep (Vue 3, TypeScript, A/B Testing, Node.js)

Here’s a focused overview to help you excel in live coding and technical Q&A for your upcoming senior frontend role. Let’s break down the key areas and what you should expect:

### 1. **A/B Testing**
- **Key Concepts**: Be ready to explain *what A/B testing is*, describe how you plan and analyze experiments, and note typical pitfalls (e.g., flicker effect, bucketing issues, statistical significance).[1]
- **Scenario Readiness**: Expect hypothetical feature questions—how you’d design, implement, monitor, and roll out an A/B test.
- **Integration in Code**: Be ready to show how you’d integrate an A/B test into a Vue app, possibly using feature flags or experiments at the component/service level.


### 2. **Vue 3 with TypeScript**
- **Component Patterns**: Understand the differences between Options API and Composition API, and be able to set up typed props, emits, and defineComponent usage for type inference.[2][3][4]
- **State Management**: Expect questions on managing state either with Vue’s built-in reactivity or common state libraries.
- **Reactivity & Lifecycle**: Be clear about how reactivity is tracked, common pitfalls, and use of lifecycle hooks in Composition API.
- **Testing**: Be ready to discuss testing strategies for components.


### 3. **TypeScript Fundamentals**
- **Core Types**: Know the basics (types, interfaces, enums, unions, generics).[5]
- **Type Inference in Vue**: How does Vue 3's defineComponent help? How to strongly type props, events, etc.?
- **Handling external data**: How do you type-check API responses or external JS libraries in a TS Vue app?


### 4. **Node.js (Basic to Intermediate)**
- **Ecosystem Knowledge**: Know async programming patterns, the event loop, working with APIs, and common optimization and security best practices.[6][7]
- **Practical Task**: You might be asked for a small server script, or demonstrate a SSR entry with Vue/Node—know the basics of express and server-side rendering.


### 5. **Coding Approach**
- **Pair Programming**: Practice concise, readable code, explaining your intentions as you type.
- **Refactoring**: Be ready to improve legacy code snippets for performance, readability, or TypeScript coverage.
- **Debugging**: If stuck, voice your thought process and suggest systematic debugging steps.


----
#### **Common Challenge/Scenario Prompts**
- "Design a feature toggle for an A/B test in a Vue 3 app. How would you ensure users see a consistent experience?"
- "Write a composable that fetches and caches API data, typed with TypeScript."
- "Given a performance bottleneck in a Node.js API, how would you profile and address it?"
- "Improve this Vue component to enforce type safety for its props and emitted events."
