# Suggestions by Claude

## Prompt

I am applying for a senior frontend developer role (focus a/b-testing; tech stack: Vue3 with Typescript, some Node.js expertise expected).

I'll have a technical interview with coding challenges during a call, so no homework to prepare.

Help me prepare for this call with, for instance, for instance typical questions, challenges, or quizzes.

## Answer

# Senior Frontend Developer Interview Prep (A/B Testing Focus)

I'll help you prepare for this technical interview. Let me break this down into key areas you should focus on:

## 1. Vue 3 + TypeScript Core Concepts

**Key Topics to Review:**
- **Composition API** (setup script, reactive, ref, computed, watch)
- **TypeScript integration** (Props typing, emit typing, generic components)
- **Lifecycle hooks** and when to use each
- **Provide/Inject** for dependency injection
- **Custom composables** for code reuse

**Potential Questions:**
- "What's the difference between `ref` and `reactive`?"
- "How do you type props and emits in Vue 3 with TypeScript?"
- "Explain the Vue 3 reactivity system and its limitations"
- "When would you use `shallowRef` vs `ref`?"

## 2. A/B Testing Specific Knowledge

**Critical Areas:**
- **Feature flagging architectures**
- **Client-side vs server-side A/B testing**
- **Statistical significance** and sample sizes
- **Variant assignment** (consistent user bucketing)
- **Performance impact** (avoiding layout shifts, flicker)
- **Analytics integration** and event tracking

**Likely Questions:**
- "How would you implement an A/B test that affects the initial page render?"
- "How do you ensure a user sees the same variant across sessions?"
- "What are the performance considerations for client-side A/B testing?"
- "How would you handle A/B testing in an SSR/SSG context?"

## 3. Practical Coding Challenges

**Vue Component Challenges:**
```typescript
// Example: Build a feature-flagged component
// - Takes a feature flag name and variant
// - Renders different content based on variant
// - Tracks impression events
```

**Common Tasks:**
- Build a reusable A/B test wrapper component
- Implement a composable for feature flags (`useFeatureFlag`)
- Create a variant tracking system
- Handle async data loading with different UI states

## 4. Algorithm/Logic Questions

Even for senior roles, expect some:
- Array manipulation (filter, map, reduce)
- Object transformations
- Debouncing/throttling implementations
- Data structure questions (not too complex, but know basics)

## 5. Node.js Backend Topics

Since they expect Node.js knowledge:
- **REST API design** principles
- **Middleware** concepts (Express/Fastify)
- **Error handling** patterns
- **Authentication/Authorization** basics
- **Database queries** (likely with an ORM)
- **API versioning** strategies

## 6. System Design (A/B Testing Platform)

Be ready to discuss:
- "How would you architect an A/B testing service?"
- Client libraries, backend services, admin dashboards
- Data flow: variant assignment → tracking → analysis
- Caching strategies for feature flags
- Real-time vs batched flag updates

## 7. Practice Exercises

**Exercise 1: Feature Flag Composable**
```typescript
// Create useFeatureFlag composable that:
// - Fetches flags from an API
// - Caches results
// - Returns the variant for a user
// - Handles loading/error states
```

**Exercise 2: A/B Test Component**
```vue
<!-- Usage: -->
<ABTest experiment="checkout-button-color">
  <template #control>
    <button class="blue">Checkout</button>
  </template>
  <template #variant>
    <button class="green">Checkout</button>
  </template>
</ABTest>
```

**Exercise 3: Variant Assignment Logic**
```typescript
// Implement consistent user bucketing
// - Same user always gets same variant
// - Even distribution across variants
// - Handle percentage-based rollouts
```

## 8. Performance & Best Practices

- **Code splitting** and lazy loading
- **Virtual scrolling** for large lists
- **Memoization** techniques
- **Bundle size optimization**
- **Web Vitals** (CLS, LCP, FID) - crucial for A/B testing
- **TypeScript strict mode** practices

## 9. Testing Knowledge

- **Unit testing** (Vitest preferred for Vue 3)
- **Component testing** (Vue Test Utils)
- **E2E testing** (Playwright/Cypress)
- **Mocking strategies** for A/B tests

## 10. Quick Prep Tips

**Before the call:**
1. Set up a blank Vue 3 + TypeScript project to have your environment ready
2. Review the Vue 3 docs, especially Composition API and TypeScript sections
3. Practice writing TypeScript interfaces/types quickly
4. Have a simple A/B testing implementation ready in your mind

**During the call:**
- Think out loud - explain your reasoning
- Ask clarifying questions before coding
- Start with a simple solution, then optimize
- Consider edge cases (loading states, errors, empty data)
- Discuss trade-offs in your approach
