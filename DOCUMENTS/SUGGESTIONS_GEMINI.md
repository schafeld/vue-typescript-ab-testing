## Prompt

I am applying for a senior frontend developer role (focus a/b-testing; tech stack: Vue3 with Typescript, some Node.js expertise expected).

I'll have a technical interview with coding challenges during a call, so no homework to prepare.

Help me prepare for this call with, for instance, for instance typical questions, challenges, or quizzes.

## Answer

That's a great role that combines modern frontend development with strategic optimization. Given your focus on **A/B testing** and your tech stack (**Vue 3 with TypeScript, Node.js**), your preparation should cover four key areas: Vue 3/TypeScript, A/B Testing Strategy/Implementation, Senior-Level Design/Architecture, and Node.js Fundamentals.

Here is a breakdown of typical questions, challenges, and quizzes to help you prepare.

***

## 1. A/B Testing Strategy & Implementation (Focus Area)

This section is critical and tests your knowledge beyond just code, proving you can integrate development with business strategy.

### Conceptual Questions
* **Client-Side vs. Server-Side A/B Testing:** Explain the differences, pros, and cons of each, and when you would recommend one over the other (e.g., server-side for heavy layout changes or testing price logic; client-side for simple text/color changes).
* **Flicker (Flash of Original Content):** What is "flicker," why does it happen in client-side testing, and what technical steps can you take in a Vue 3 application to mitigate it?
* **User Consistency:** How do you ensure a user who sees a variant (B) on the homepage will see the *same* variant on all subsequent pages in their session, even if they log in or navigate? (Keywords: Cookies, Local Storage, User ID assignment).
* **Data Integrity and QA:** What are your best practices for QAing an A/B test? How do you ensure the variant implementation isn't introducing performance degradation or data collection errors?
* **Instrumentation:** Describe how you would implement **event tracking** (e.g., clicks, views, conversions) specifically within a Vue 3 component to report test results to an analytics tool (e.g., Google Analytics, custom service).

### Implementation Challenge (Quasi-Coding)
**Scenario:** "You need to run an A/B test on a critical **call-to-action (CTA)** button within a `ProductCard` component in your Vue 3 application. The control (A) button is blue, and the variant (B) is red."

**Task:** Describe or sketch the Composition API approach (using a `composable`) to:
1.  Read the assigned variant (`'A'` or `'B'`) from a global A/B testing service (simulated).
2.  Apply the correct styling/logic to the button in the `ProductCard.vue` component.
3.  Ensure the variant assignment only happens once per user (sticky assignment).

## 2. Vue 3 & TypeScript Expertise

As a senior developer, you'll be tested on architectural decisions, performance, and type safety.

### Vue 3 & Composition API
* **Composition vs. Options API:** Explain the fundamental differences and why the Composition API is generally preferred for large-scale, senior-level work (e.g., better logic extraction, type inference).
* **Reactivity System:** Explain in detail how Vue 3's reactivity system works (`ref`, `reactive`, proxies) and the difference between them. When would you use a `shallowRef` or `shallowReactive`?
* **Composables:** How do you structure and test a complex custom composable (e.g., one that handles form validation or an API fetch)? Provide an example.
* **State Management:** Discuss the pros and cons of **Pinia** (the recommended Vue 3 state manager) over Vuex. How do you integrate it with TypeScript?
* **Performance Optimization:** What techniques do you use to optimize Vue 3 component rendering and initial load time (e.g., `v-once`, lazy loading, `keep-alive`, use of `Teleport`, managing large lists)?

### TypeScript
* **Deep Type Safety:** Beyond basic types, how do you handle complex types for **props** in Vue 3 (using `defineProps` and interfaces/types)?
* **Typing Composables and API Data:** How do you ensure a custom composable is fully typed? How would you define a discriminated union to handle the state of an asynchronous API call (e.g., `Loading | Success<T> | Error<E>`)?
* **Generics:** When and how do you use **generics** in TypeScript to create reusable Vue components or utility functions?

### Coding Challenge (TypeScript/Composition API)
**Challenge:** Implement a custom Vue 3 composable, `$useDebouncedRef(value, delay)` that returns a reactive `Ref` that only updates its value after a specified delay of inactivity.

***

## 3. Senior-Level System Design & Architecture

These questions assess your ability to design scalable, maintainable systems.

* **Project Structure:** How would you structure a large, multi-feature Vue/TypeScript project to ensure scalability, easy maintenance, and clear separation of concerns (e.g., organizing `composables`, `stores`, `components`, and utility functions)?
* **Component Architecture:** When would you use a **Smart/Container Component** versus a **Dumb/Presentational Component**?
* **Code Review Process:** Describe your approach to conducting a constructive code review for another senior developer. What are the top three things you look for?
* **Micro-Frontends:** Do you have experience with or an opinion on using Vue 3 in a micro-frontend architecture? If so, what are the key challenges (e.g., cross-application communication, routing)?

***

## 4. Node.js Fundamentals

As Node.js expertise is expected, you should be ready to discuss its role, especially in a frontend-focused context (e.g., build tools, server-side rendering, or API mocking).

* **Event Loop:** Explain the Node.js **Event Loop**. This is a classic question. Focus on how it enables non-blocking I/O.
* **Asynchronous Handling:** Compare and contrast the use of **Callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`** in Node.js.
* **Streams:** What are **Streams** in Node.js, and when would a frontend developer use them (e.g., efficient handling of large file uploads/downloads)?
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** If you were using a framework like **Nuxt 3** (which uses Vue and Node.js) for SSR, what are the primary benefits and challenges compared to a purely client-side rendered application?

## Preparation Tips for the Call üìù

1.  **Practice Explaining:** Don't just know the answers; practice explaining *why* you choose a particular solution. For example, explain *why* Composition API and Pinia are better for scalability.
2.  **Focus on the "Senior" Aspect:** For every question, try to elevate your answer by discussing: **Trade-offs**, **Performance implications**, **Testing strategy**, and **Maintenance/Scalability**.
3.  **Code Challenge Environment:** Be familiar with the environment (e.g., CoderPad, shared screen) and the basic Vue 3 setup without a full build process. Focus on clear logic and correct TypeScript typing, not perfect UI/CSS.
4.  **A/B Testing Terminology:** Brush up on terms like **Statistical Significance**, **Sample Size**, **Hypothesis**, and the **P-value** (even if you're not a Data Scientist, knowing the context of these terms shows maturity).
