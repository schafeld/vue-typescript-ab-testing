## Prompt

I am applying for a senior frontend developer role (focus a/b-testing; tech stack: Vue3 with Typescript, some Node.js expertise expected).

I'll have a technical interview with coding challenges during a call, so no homework to prepare.

Help me prepare for this call with, for instance, for instance typical questions, challenges, or quizzes.

## Answer

Perfect — a **senior frontend role** with **Vue 3 + TypeScript** focus and some **A/B testing** experience expected means your interview will likely blend:

1. **Frontend architecture & best practices (Vue, TypeScript)**
2. **Practical coding challenges (usually live-coding small UI logic or data manipulation)**
3. **A/B testing principles (experimentation frameworks, metrics, validation)**
4. **Some Node.js fundamentals (API integration, lightweight back-end logic)**
5. **Soft questions** about collaboration, testing, and scaling.

Let’s go step by step.

---

## 🧠 1. Typical Interview Topics

### **A. Vue 3 + TypeScript Core**

Expect discussion and live-coding around:

* The **Composition API** (vs Options API)
* **Reactivity system** (`ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, `watch`)
* **Lifecycle hooks** (`onMounted`, `onUpdated`, etc.)
* **Component communication** (props, emits, provide/inject, state management)
* **TypeScript patterns** in Vue (typing props, emits, component state)
* **Performance optimization** (lazy loading, memoization, virtual lists)
* **Testing Vue components** (Jest, Vue Testing Library)

🧩 Example questions:

* “What’s the difference between `ref()` and `reactive()` in Vue 3?”
* “How would you type a component prop that accepts both string and number?”
* “How do you share reactive state between multiple components without Vuex/Pinia?”
* “What’s a scenario where `watchEffect` is better than `watch`?”
* “How do you lazy-load a component in Vue Router?”

---

### **B. A/B Testing & Experimentation**

As this is *core* to the role, expect practical questions:

* How to **integrate A/B testing frameworks** (Optimizely, VWO, internal tools)
* Managing **feature flags** and **experiments** cleanly
* Ensuring **statistical validity** (sample size, significance, metrics)
* Avoiding **flicker** or **layout shifts** due to experiments
* Handling **variant tracking** in analytics tools

🧩 Example questions:

* “How would you implement a lightweight A/B testing mechanism in Vue?”
* “How can you ensure users stay in the same variant after page reload?”
* “What metrics would you track for an experiment testing a new signup form?”
* “How do you prevent the ‘flicker effect’ when running front-end experiments?”

---

### **C. Node.js Basics (Expected Breadth)**

They won’t expect deep backend expertise, but you should know:

* Basic **Express.js** or API handling logic
* Writing small **middleware** or proxy functions
* Integrating **REST/GraphQL APIs** in the frontend
* Environment variables & configuration patterns

🧩 Example questions:

* “Write an Express middleware that logs request times.”
* “How would you serve an A/B testing configuration from a Node endpoint?”
* “What’s the difference between a blocking and a non-blocking call in Node?”

---

## ⚙️ 2. Coding Challenge Examples

These will likely be **20–40 min live tasks**, not full apps.

### 🧩 Example 1: A/B Variant Loader

> “Create a Vue 3 component that loads one of two variants (‘A’ or ‘B’) randomly and persists that choice in `localStorage`.”

**They expect:**

* Correct use of Composition API
* Clean TypeScript
* Proper lifecycle handling
* Avoiding reactivity pitfalls

*Possible extension:*

> “Now, make sure that once a variant is selected, it doesn’t change on reload.”

---

### 🧩 Example 2: Filtering and Sorting Data

> “You’re given an array of users with names and ages. Build a simple Vue component that lists them, allows sorting by age/name, and filters by a search term.”

**They check for:**

* Reactive data (`ref`, `computed`)
* Correctly typed interfaces
* Clean reactivity and performance (no unnecessary recomputation)

---

### 🧩 Example 3: A/B Flag Service (Node.js)

> “Write a Node.js function that returns which variant a user should see based on a percentage split.”

**Example:**

```ts
function getVariant(userId: string): 'A' | 'B' {
  // deterministic 50/50 split
}
```

They test your grasp of hashing, deterministic randomness, and code clarity.

---

### 🧩 Example 4: Async / API Task

> “Fetch data from an API and display it in a Vue component, with loading and error states.”

Tests:

* `async setup()`, or `onMounted(async () => {})`
* Type-safe fetching
* State management (loading/error/data)
* Clean UI flow

---

## 🔍 3. Common Quick Quizzes

**JS/TS fundamentals:**

* Difference between `interface` and `type`
* Generics in TypeScript (`<T>` usage)
* Async/await vs Promises
* Deep vs shallow copy of objects
* Event loop basics (microtasks, macrotasks)

**Frontend performance:**

* What triggers re-render in Vue
* Debouncing/throttling in search
* Lazy loading images/components
* Bundle splitting

**A/B Testing:**

* “What’s the minimum detectable effect?”
* “How long should an experiment run?”
* “Why would you stop an experiment early?”
* “How do you avoid overlapping experiments?”

---

## 💬 4. Behavioral / Collaboration Questions

* “Describe a time you implemented an A/B test that changed a major UX decision.”
* “How do you ensure the quality of code in a fast-paced testing environment?”
* “How do you balance shipping experiments quickly with maintaining code health?”
* “What tools or frameworks have you used for analytics or experimentation?”

---

## 🧩 5. How to Prepare (Practically)

**Before interview:**

* Brush up on **Vue 3 Composition API + TS** syntax (build a small component or two).
* Practice live-coding with **StackBlitz** or **CodeSandbox** (simulate call setting).
* Review **A/B testing fundamentals** (flicker mitigation, persistence, analytics).
* Revise **TypeScript utility types** (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Record`, etc.).
* Refresh **Node basics** (Express.js endpoints, middlewares, environment handling).

Would you like me to **simulate** a realistic *live-coding challenge* (like one you might face in that interview) — and then we can walk through how you’d solve it step by step in Vue 3 with TypeScript?
